Unusual conditions occurring at run time are referred to as **exceptions**. Most exceptions occur *synchronously* to the current CPU thread. All exceptions transfer control to an **exception handler**.

External events occurring *asynchronously* to the current CPU thread are referred to as **interrupts**.

All types of exceptions that can be generated by instructions are described later.
